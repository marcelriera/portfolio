          <h2>2048 Game A.I. Solve Algorithm</h2>
          <p>2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer
            Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine
            them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game
            after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.</p>
          <p>The purpose of developing this project was to practice Object Oriented Programming in Java,
            get more familiarized with the Swing architecture, practice KeyBoard event input, and work
            on algorithm development.
            Mainly, the motivation behind recreating this classic game was to attempt to build an A.I.
            algorithm that could reach higher scores than what is humanly capable.</p>
          <p>For this project, the user inteface design was based on the Queens project. It contains
            two modes; default gameplay and A.I. The default gameplay is the regular game, with same
            mechanics as the original. The A.I. mode allows the computer to start solving the game by
            itself.</b>
          <p>The application also implements a save/load feature, allowing the user to continue their
            gameplay after closing the application, plus remembering achieved highscores from past
            sessions. The user can also hover over the highscores to see the final arrangement of the
            board in that particular gameplay.</p>
