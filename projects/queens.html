          <h2>Eight Queens Recursive Algorithm</h2>
          <p>The eight queens problem is a well known algorithm challenge. The objective
            of the problem is to place eight queens in an 8x8 chessboard in such a way
            that no two queens treat each other.</p>
          <p>This program was developed in Java language, while using Swing architecture
            to provide a graphical interface. The program generates all possible solutions
            to the eight queens problem, showing each of them in the UI board.
            The program has two different modes of operation; regular and fundamental.
            In the regular mode the algorithm counts all solutions as valid, for a total
            of 93 in the 8x8 board. In the other hand, fundamental mode shows solutions
            if and only if they are not axial translations from other solutions, hence
            counting 13 in total.</p>
          <p>The heart of this project is the recursive method that solves a board. The
            algorithm keeps calling himself until it finds a valid solution. The amount
            of recursions made by the algorithm for every solution can be seen in the steps
            field at the bottom right corner of the UI.</p>
          <pre><code data-src="/load/code/queens.txt" class='prism language-java'></code></pre>
          <p>Another important peace of the problem is to find fundamental solutions.
            The way the program handles this task is by the use of a Set for all solutions; each
            time a new solution is found, a method rotates the board three times and adds each
            case to the solutions set. Then, another method takes the same solution and finds
            its symmetric copy, adding it to the set. Finally, the program considers a solution
            fundamental if and only if its not currently on the solution's set.</p>
